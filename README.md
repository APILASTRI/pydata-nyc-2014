A Machine Learning Pipeline with Scikit-Learn
===

This repo includes all of the ipython notebooks that I will go through
in the [tutorial](http://pydata.org/nyc2014/abstracts/#289). It is targeted to people
who have beginner to intermediate features.  
It covers from basic concepts of Scikit-Learn(unsupervised learning, supervised learning
and cross validation) to pipelines, grid search, model selection and deployment process. 

The dependencies are given in the 0th notebook, to reproduce it, makes sure you
have at least those versions in that notebook. Otherwise, please feel free to 
open an issue in this repository.
